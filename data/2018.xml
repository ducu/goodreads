    <book_description><![CDATA[A work of striking originality bursting with unexpected insights, <i>The Human Condition</i> is a in many respects more relevant now than when it first appeared in 1958. In her study of the state of modern humanity, Hannah Arendt considers humankind from the perspective of the actions of which it is capable. The problems Arendt identified then--diminishing human agency and political freedom; the paradox that as human powers increase through technological and humanistic inquiry, we are less equipped to control the consequences of our actions—continue to confront us today.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[One of the strongest works of moral philosophy of the last two decades, <em>Humanity</em> presents deeply felt and disturbing meditations on the 20th century's most brutal historical episodes. Jonathan Glover ambitiously attempts a moral psychology, tracing the patterns of human psychology that breed violence. Shrewd case studies examine the intellectual follies and moral horrors of the First World War's trench warfare, Hitler's Holocaust, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, the ideologically driven social experimentation by Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot, and the ethnic and tribal hatreds that tore apart the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Utilitarianism may well be the most influential secular ethical theory in the world today. It is also one of the most controversial. It clashes, or is widely thought to clash, with many conventional moral views, and with human rights when they are seen as inviolable. Would it, for example, be right to torture a suspected terrorist in order to prevent an attack that could kill and injure a large number of innocent people?<br /><br />In this Very Short Introduction Peter Singer and Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek provide an authoritative account of the nature of utilitarianism, from its nineteenth-century origins, to its justification and its varieties. Considering how utilitarians can respond to objections that are often regarded as devastating, they explore the utilitarian answer to the question of whether torture can ever be justified. They also discuss what it is that utilitarians should seek to maximize, paying<br />special attention to the classical utilitarian view that only pleasure or happiness is of intrinsic value. Singer and de Lazari-Radek conclude by analysing the continuing importance of utilitarianism in the world, indicating how it is a force for new thinking on contemporary moral challenges like global poverty,<br />the treatment of animals, climate change, reducing the risk of human extinction, end-of-life decisions for terminally-ill patients, and the shift towards assessing the success of government policies in terms of their impact on happiness.<br /><br />ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[Excellent walk-through of utilitarianism, the most rational yet most controversial ethical theory today. Although utilitarianism is often seen in contrast with deontology (e.g. Kantian ethics), I think it should be framed exactly as a duty. Kant himself affirmed that well-doing, when possible, is a duty, especially because we are not naturally inclined to it, so it can only arise from our good will. But what is well-doing if not attending to the well-being of others? One objection to utilitarianism is that, for one, it is too demanding, but I think that, for all of us, it is not demanding enough.]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>How should we treat non-human animals? </b>In this immensely powerful and influential book (now with a new introduction by <i>Sapiens </i>author Yuval Noah Harari), the renowned moral philosopher Peter Singer addresses this simple question with trenchant, dispassionate reasoning. Accompanied by the disturbing evidence of factory farms and laboratories, his answers triggered the birth of the animal rights movement.<br /><br /><b>'An extraordinary book which has had extraordinary effects... Widely known as the bible of the animal liberation movement' <i>Independent on Sunday</i></b><br /><br />In the decades since this landmark classic first appeared, some public attitudes to animals may have changed but our continued abuse of animals in factory farms and as tools for research shows that the underlying ideas Singer exposes as ethically indefensible are still dominating the way we treat animals. As Yuval Harari’s brilliantly argued introduction makes clear, this book is as relevant now as the day it was written.]]></book_description>
